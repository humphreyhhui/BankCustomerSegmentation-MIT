Here is a project I did for the MIT Applied Data Science Program, where I:
- Utilized clustering algorithms such as K-Means, K-Medoids, and Gaussian Mixture Models on scaled datasets to segment customer populations.
- Evaluated clustering results by plotting SSE against cluster count to create and analyze elbow plots for determining optimal clustering solutions.
